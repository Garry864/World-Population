# üåç World Population Analysis

Welcome to the **World Population Analysis** repository! This project provides a comprehensive exploration of global population trends, geographical distributions, and predictive modeling for future population estimates. By analyzing historical population data from 1970 to 2022, this project sheds light on key insights regarding the world‚Äôs population growth, density, and regional disparities.

## üìñ Project Overview

This analysis uses a dataset containing **234 records** of world population data from **1970 to 2022**. The dataset includes information about countries, continents, population figures, area (km¬≤), density, growth rate, and world population percentage. The goal is to understand population trends, regional disparities, and build predictive models for future population estimates.

## ‚ú® Key Insights

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Data Acquisition**
- The data was obtained through:
  - **gdown** library for downloading the dataset.
  - Direct referencing from Google Drive to read the dataset into a pandas DataFrame.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Data Summary**
- The dataset includes **234 rows** and **17 columns**, featuring:
  - **Country/Territory**, **Capital**, **Continent**
  - Population figures for years 1970 to 2022
  - Area (km¬≤), Population Density (per km¬≤), Growth Rate, World Population Percentage

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Data Cleaning & Validation**
- **No duplicates** were found in the dataset, ensuring data integrity.
- Missing value analysis revealed **no missing values** across all columns.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- **Descriptive Statistics**: Calculated mean, standard deviation, min, max, and percentiles for features like population, area, and density.
- **Key Findings**:
  - Global population has been increasing over time with a steady upward trend.
  - Large variation in population sizes across countries, with a few highly populous nations skewing the global distribution.
  - Significant disparities in population density and growth rates between continents and countries.
  
- **Visualizations**:
  - **Line Chart**: Population trends by continent from 1970 to 2022.
  - **Bar Charts**: 
    - Land area comparison among countries.
    - Population comparisons by continent across different years.
    - Top 5 countries with the highest population density.
  - **Pie Charts**: 
    - Growth rates by continent.
    - Contribution of each country to the world population in 2022.

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ **Key Findings from EDA**
- **Africa** exhibited the highest population growth rate.
- **Asia** had the highest population, largest land area, and population density.
- **Moldova** had the highest population growth rate among individual countries.
- **Macau** had the highest population density.

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ **Predictive Modeling**
- **Objective**: Forecast the world population for 2022 based on historical data (1970-2020).
- **Models Used**:
  - Linear Regression
  - Random Forest
  - Decision Tree
  - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
  
- **Model Evaluation**:
  - **Linear Regression** achieved the highest **R¬≤ score (~99%)**, making it the best-performing model for predicting the 2022 population.
